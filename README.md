## draw fast

This is a fun exploration project I built during Tldraw hack night 🧑‍💻 the purpose of this hack night is to try out different ideas about LCM, a realtime stable diffusion model, on the 2D Canvas.

Draw fast twice is a concpet about making the linked list or a pipeline where we can pass the result from a frame down to the next frame (as the input)! 

Just...

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
